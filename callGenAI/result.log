2025-11-30 21:15:45.169924 - PROMPT: code to find out even number
2025-11-30 21:15:45.169976 - RESPONSE: To find out if a number is even, you generally check if it is perfectly divisible by 2. In most programming languages, you can do this using the **modulo operator** (`%`).

The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, it's an even number. Otherwise, it's odd.

Here's how you can do it in Python:

---

### 1. Simple Check for a Single Number

```python
number = 10

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")

# Test with an odd number
number = 7
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")

# Test with zero
number = 0
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")
```

**Explanation:**
*   `number % 2` calculates the remainder when `number` is divided by 2.
*   If the remainder is `0`, the `if` condition is `True`, and the number is even.
*   Otherwise, the `else` block is executed, and the number is odd.

---

### 2. Using a Function (Recommended for Reusability)

It's often better to wrap this logic in a function so you can easily reuse it for different numbers.

```python
def is_even(number):
    """
    Checks if a given integer is an even number.
    Returns True if even, False if odd.
    """
    if not isinstance(number, int):
        # Handle cases where input is not an integer (optional but good practice)
        if isinstance(number, float) and number.is_integer():
            number = int(number) # Treat 4.0 as integer 4
        else:
            print(f"Warning: '{number}' is not an integer. Returning False.")
            return False

    return number % 2 == 0

# Test the function
print(f"Is 4 even? {is_even(4)}")       # Output: Is 4 even? True
print(f"Is 7 even? {is_even(7)}")       # Output: Is 7 even? False
print(f"Is 0 even? {is_even(0)}")       # Output: Is 0 even? True
print(f"Is -2 even? {is_even(-2)}")     # Output: Is -2 even? True
print(f"Is -5 even? {is_even(-5)}")     # Output: Is -5 even? False
print(f"Is 4.0 even? {is_even(4.0)}")   # Output: Is 4.0 even? True (handled float integers)
print(f"Is 4.5 even? {is_even(4.5)}")   # Output: Warning: '4.5' is not an integer. Returning False. Is 4.5 even? False
print(f"Is 'hello' even? {is_even('hello')}") # Output: Warning: 'hello' is not an integer. Returning False. Is 'hello' even? False
```

**Explanation:**
*   The `is_even()` function takes one argument, `number`.
*   It directly returns the result of `number % 2 == 0`, which will be `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.
*   I've added a basic type check to handle non-integer inputs gracefully, which is a good practice for robust code.

---

### 3. Finding Even Numbers in a List or Range

You can use the `is_even` function or the direct modulo check to filter even numbers from a collection.

**Example 1: Using a `for` loop**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -3, -4]
even_numbers = []

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(num)

print(f"Even numbers in the list: {even_numbers}")
# Output: Even numbers in the list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -4]
```

**Example 2: Using a List Comprehension (more Pythonic)**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -3, -4]

even_numbers_comprehension = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers (comprehension): {even_numbers_comprehension}")
# Output: Even numbers (comprehension): [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -4]

# Find even numbers in a range
even_in_range = [num for num in range(21) if num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers from 0 to 20: {even_in_range}")
# Output: Even numbers from 0 to 20: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```

Choose the method that best fits your specific need! The function approach is generally the most flexible and maintainable.

2025-11-30 21:22:05.081120 - RESPONSE: To find out if a number is even, you generally check if it is perfectly divisible by 2. In most programming languages, you use the **modulo operator (%)** for this. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division.

If `number % 2` equals `0`, then the number is even.

Here's how you can do it in Python, with a few different approaches:

---

### 1. Checking a Single Number (using a function)

This is the most common and recommended way to encapsulate the logic.

```python
def is_even(number):
  """
  Checks if a given number is even.

  Args:
    number: An integer.

  Returns:
    True if the number is even, False otherwise.
  """
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# --- Test Cases ---
print(f"Is 4 even? {is_even(4)}")      # Output: Is 4 even? True
print(f"Is 7 even? {is_even(7)}")      # Output: Is 7 even? False
print(f"Is 0 even? {is_even(0)}")      # Output: Is 0 even? True (0 is considered even)
print(f"Is -2 even? {is_even(-2)}")    # Output: Is -2 even? True
print(f"Is -3 even? {is_even(-3)}")    # Output: Is -3 even? False

# A more concise way for the function:
def is_even_concise(number):
  return number % 2 == 0

print(f"\nUsing concise function:")
print(f"Is 10 even? {is_even_concise(10)}")
print(f"Is 11 even? {is_even_concise(11)}")
```

**Explanation:**
*   The `is_even` function takes one argument, `number`.
*   `number % 2` calculates the remainder when `number` is divided by 2.
*   If the remainder is `0`, it means the number is perfectly divisible by 2, hence it's even.
*   The `is_even_concise` version is more "Pythonic" as `number % 2 == 0` itself evaluates to `True` or `False`.

---

### 2. Finding Even Numbers in a List

You can iterate through a list of numbers and apply the `is_even` check to each one.

```python
def find_even_numbers_in_list(numbers_list):
  """
  Finds all even numbers within a list.

  Args:
    numbers_list: A list of integers.

  Returns:
    A new list containing only the even numbers.
  """
  even_numbers = []
  for number in numbers_list:
    if number % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(number)
  return even_numbers

my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -1, -2, -100]
even_found = find_even_numbers_in_list(my_numbers)
print(f"Original list: {my_numbers}")
print(f"Even numbers in the list: {even_found}")
# Output: Even numbers in the list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -2, -100]
```

---

### 3. Using List Comprehension (Pythonic way for lists)

List comprehensions offer a more compact and often more readable way to create lists based on existing ones.

```python
my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -1, -2, -100]

# Find even numbers using list comprehension
even_numbers_comprehension = [num for num in my_numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(f"Original list: {my_numbers}")
print(f"Even numbers (list comprehension): {even_numbers_comprehension}")
# Output: Even numbers (list comprehension): [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -2, -100]
```

---

### 4. Getting User Input and Checking

```python
def check_user_input_for_even():
  """
  Prompts the user for a number and tells them if it's even or odd.
  Handles non-integer input gracefully.
  """
  try:
    user_input = input("Enter an integer: ")
    number = int(user_input)

    if number % 2 == 0:
      print(f"{number} is an even number.")
    else:
      print(f"{number} is an odd number.")

  except ValueError:
    print(f"'{user_input}' is not a valid integer. Please enter a whole number.")
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function to run the interactive check
# check_user_input_for_even()
# check_user_input_for_even() # You can call it multiple times
```

Choose the method that best suits your needs! For a single number, the `is_even` function is ideal. For a list, list comprehension is very efficient and readable.

2025-11-30 21:22:56.688986 - RESPONSE: To find out if a number is even, you generally check if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder. In programming, this is typically done using the **modulo operator (`%`)**.

The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division. If `number % 2` equals `0`, then the number is even.

Here are several ways to implement this in Python:

---

### 1. Check a Single Number

This is the most basic and common scenario.

```python
def is_even(number):
  """Checks if a given number is even."""
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# --- Examples ---
print(f"Is 4 even? {is_even(4)}")       # Output: Is 4 even? True
print(f"Is 7 even? {is_even(7)}")       # Output: Is 7 even? False
print(f"Is 0 even? {is_even(0)}")       # Output: Is 0 even? True
print(f"Is -2 even? {is_even(-2)}")     # Output: Is -2 even? True
print(f"Is -3 even? {is_even(-3)}")     # Output: Is -3 even? False

# A more concise way to write the same function:
def is_even_concise(number):
  return number % 2 == 0

print(f"Is 10 even (concise)? {is_even_concise(10)}") # Output: Is 10 even (concise)? True
```

---

### 2. Find Even Numbers in a List

You can iterate through a list of numbers and pick out the even ones.

#### Using a `for` loop:

```python
def find_even_numbers_in_list_loop(numbers_list):
  """Finds all even numbers in a given list using a for loop."""
  even_numbers = []
  for num in numbers_list:
    if num % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(num)
  return even_numbers

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -2, -5]
even_nums = find_even_numbers_in_list_loop(my_list)
print(f"Even numbers in {my_list}: {even_nums}")
# Output: Even numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -2, -5]: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -2]
```

#### Using List Comprehension (more Pythonic):

```python
def find_even_numbers_in_list_comprehension(numbers_list):
  """Finds all even numbers in a given list using list comprehension."""
  return [num for num in numbers_list if num % 2 == 0]

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -2, -5]
even_nums_comp = find_even_numbers_in_list_comprehension(my_list)
print(f"Even numbers in {my_list} (comprehension): {even_nums_comp}")
# Output: Even numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -2, -5] (comprehension): [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -2]
```

---

### 3. Generate Even Numbers within a Range

You can create a list of even numbers within a specified range.

#### Using `range()` with a step:

If you want to generate even numbers efficiently, you can use the `range()` function's `step` argument. You just need to make sure your starting number is even.

```python
def generate_even_numbers_in_range_step(start, end):
  """Generates even numbers in a range [start, end] using range with a step."""
  if start % 2 != 0:  # If start is odd, adjust it to the next even number
    start += 1
  # range(start, stop, step) - stop is exclusive, so end+1 to include 'end'
  return list(range(start, end + 1, 2))

even_range = generate_even_numbers_in_range_step(1, 10)
print(f"Even numbers from 1 to 10: {even_range}")
# Output: Even numbers from 1 to 10: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

even_range_2 = generate_even_numbers_in_range_step(2, 11)
print(f"Even numbers from 2 to 11: {even_range_2}")
# Output: Even numbers from 2 to 11: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

even_range_3 = generate_even_numbers_in_range_step(-5, 5)
print(f"Even numbers from -5 to 5: {even_range_3}")
# Output: Even numbers from -5 to 5: [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]
```

#### Using `range()` and filtering with list comprehension:

```python
def generate_even_numbers_in_range_filter(start, end):
  """Generates even numbers in a range [start, end] by filtering."""
  return [num for num in range(start, end + 1) if num % 2 == 0]

even_range_filtered = generate_even_numbers_in_range_filter(1, 10)
print(f"Even numbers from 1 to 10 (filtered): {even_range_filtered}")
# Output: Even numbers from 1 to 10 (filtered): [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

---

### Summary of Key Concept: The Modulo Operator (`%`)

The core idea in all these examples is the modulo operator (`%`).
*   `x % y` gives you the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`.
*   For even numbers, the remainder when divided by 2 is always `0`.
*   For odd numbers, the remainder when divided by 2 is always `1` (or `-1` for negative odd numbers in some languages, but Python gives `1` for negative odd numbers like `-3 % 2 == 1`).

Choose the method that best fits your specific needs! For checking a single number, `is_even(number)` is perfect. For lists or ranges, list comprehensions are often the most concise and Pythonic.

2025-11-30 21:24:35.711491 - PROMPT: code to find out even number
2025-11-30 21:24:35.711559 - RESPONSE: To find out if a number is even, you generally use the **modulo operator (`%`)**. An even number is any integer that is perfectly divisible by 2, meaning it leaves no remainder when divided by 2.

Here's how you can do it in Python, along with different ways to use this logic:

### The Core Logic (Modulo Operator)

The key is: `number % 2 == 0`

*   `%` is the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of a division.
*   If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, the number is even.
*   Otherwise, it's odd.

---

### 1. Simple Function to Check a Single Number

This is the most common and reusable way.

```python
def is_even(number):
  """
  Checks if a given number is even.

  Args:
    number: An integer.

  Returns:
    True if the number is even, False otherwise.
  """
  if isinstance(number, int): # Ensure it's an integer for correct modulo behavior
      return number % 2 == 0
  else:
      # Handle non-integer input if necessary, or just let it error for simplicity
      raise TypeError("Input must be an integer.")

# --- Examples ---
print(f"Is 4 even? {is_even(4)}")       # Output: Is 4 even? True
print(f"Is 7 even? {is_even(7)}")       # Output: Is 7 even? False
print(f"Is 0 even? {is_even(0)}")       # Output: Is 0 even? True (0 is an even number)
print(f"Is -2 even? {is_even(-2)}")     # Output: Is -2 even? True
print(f"Is -5 even? {is_even(-5)}")     # Output: Is -5 even? False

try:
    print(is_even(4.5))
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: Input must be an integer.
```

**Explanation:**
The `is_even` function takes a `number` as input. It returns `True` if `number % 2` results in `0`, and `False` otherwise. The `isinstance` check adds robustness.

---

### 2. Getting User Input

```python
def check_user_number():
  """Prompts the user for a number and tells them if it's even or odd."""
  try:
    num_str = input("Enter an integer: ")
    num = int(num_str) # Convert input string to an integer

    if num % 2 == 0:
      print(f"{num} is an even number.")
    else:
      print(f"{num} is an odd number.")

  except ValueError:
    print(f"Invalid input: '{num_str}' is not a valid integer. Please try again.")

# --- Run the user input check ---
# check_user_number()
```

**Explanation:**
This script prompts the user to enter a number. It then uses a `try-except` block to handle cases where the user might enter non-integer text. If the input is valid, it applies the modulo logic.

---

### 3. Finding Even Numbers in a List

```python
def find_even_numbers_in_list(numbers_list):
  """
  Finds all even numbers within a given list of numbers.

  Args:
    numbers_list: A list of integers.

  Returns:
    A new list containing only the even numbers.
  """
  even_numbers = []
  for num in numbers_list:
    if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(num)
  return even_numbers

# --- Examples ---
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -2, -5, 3.14]
evens_in_list = find_even_numbers_in_list(my_list)
print(f"Even numbers in {my_list}: {evens_in_list}")
# Output: Even numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -2, -5, 3.14]: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -2]

# --- Pythonic way using List Comprehension ---
even_numbers_comprehension = [num for num in my_list if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers (comprehension): {even_numbers_comprehension}")
```

**Explanation:**
This function iterates through a list. For each item, it checks if it's an integer and if it's even, then adds it to a new list. The list comprehension provides a more concise way to achieve the same result.

---

### 4. Printing Even Numbers in a Range

```python
def print_even_numbers_in_range(start, end):
  """
  Prints all even numbers within a specified range (inclusive).

  Args:
    start: The starting integer of the range.
    end: The ending integer of the range.
  """
  print(f"Even numbers between {start} and {end} (inclusive):")
  for i in range(start, end + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
      print(i)

# --- Example ---
print_even_numbers_in_range(1, 15)
# Output:
# Even numbers between 1 and 15 (inclusive):
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# 12
# 14

# --- More efficient for just even numbers ---
print("\nEven numbers using step in range:")
for i in range(0, 16, 2): # Start from 0 (or 2 if you don't want 0), go up to (but not including) 16, step by 2
    if i >= 1: # If you specifically want to exclude 0 from the range [1, 15]
        print(i)
```

**Explanation:**
This function uses a `for` loop and the `range()` function to iterate through numbers from `start` to `end`. It then applies the modulo check to each number and prints it if it's even. The second example `range(0, 16, 2)` shows a more direct way to generate even numbers by stepping by 2.

2025-11-30 21:25:57.427370 - RESPONSE: Finding out if a number is even is a fundamental concept in programming. An even number is any integer that is perfectly divisible by 2, meaning it leaves no remainder when divided by 2.

The most common way to check this is by using the **modulo operator (`%`)**.

---

### The Core Concept: Modulo Operator (`%`)

The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division.
*   If `number % 2` is `0`, then the number is even.
*   If `number % 2` is `1` (or `-1` for negative odd numbers in some languages, but usually it's `1` or `0` for Python for non-zero remainders), then the number is odd.

---

### Python Code Examples

Here are several ways to implement this in Python:

#### 1. Checking a Single Number (Basic Function)

This is the most direct way to check if a specific number is even.

```python
def is_even(number):
  """
  Checks if a given number is even.
  Returns True if even, False if odd.
  """
  if number % 2 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# Test cases
print(f"Is 4 even? {is_even(4)}")       # Output: Is 4 even? True
print(f"Is 7 even? {is_even(7)}")       # Output: Is 7 even? False
print(f"Is 0 even? {is_even(0)}")       # Output: Is 0 even? True (0 is considered even)
print(f"Is -2 even? {is_even(-2)}")     # Output: Is -2 even? True
print(f"Is -3 even? {is_even(-3)}")     # Output: Is -3 even? False
```

**Simplified `is_even` function:**
Since `number % 2 == 0` already evaluates to a boolean (`True` or `False`), you can simplify the function:

```python
def is_even_simplified(number):
  """
  Checks if a given number is even (simplified version).
  Returns True if even, False if odd.
  """
  return number % 2 == 0

print(f"Is 10 even? {is_even_simplified(10)}") # Output: Is 10 even? True
print(f"Is 11 even? {is_even_simplified(11)}") # Output: Is 11 even? False
```

---

#### 2. Finding Even Numbers in a List

You can iterate through a list of numbers and collect all the even ones.

```python
def find_even_numbers_in_list(numbers_list):
  """
  Finds all even numbers in a given list.
  Returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
  """
  even_numbers = []
  for num in numbers_list:
    if num % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(num)
  return even_numbers

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -4, -7]
even_nums = find_even_numbers_in_list(my_list)
print(f"Even numbers in the list: {even_nums}")
# Output: Even numbers in the list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -4]
```

**Using List Comprehension (more Pythonic):**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, -4, -7]

even_numbers_comprehension = [num for num in my_list if num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers (list comprehension): {even_numbers_comprehension}")
# Output: Even numbers (list comprehension): [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0, -4]
```

---

#### 3. Finding Even Numbers within a Range

You can generate numbers within a specific range and identify the even ones.

```python
def find_even_numbers_in_range(start, end):
  """
  Finds all even numbers within a specified range (inclusive).
  Returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
  """
  even_numbers = []
  # range(start, end + 1) because range() is exclusive of the end number
  for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if num % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(num)
  return even_numbers

start_num = 1
end_num = 20
even_in_range = find_even_numbers_in_range(start_num, end_num)
print(f"Even numbers from {start_num} to {end_num}: {even_in_range}")
# Output: Even numbers from 1 to 20: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```

**Using List Comprehension for Range:**

```python
start_num = -5
end_num = 5
even_in_range_comprehension = [num for num in range(start_num, end_num + 1) if num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers from {start_num} to {end_num} (comprehension): {even_in_range_comprehension}")
# Output: Even numbers from -5 to 5 (comprehension): [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]
```

#### 4. Interactive Example (User Input)

Let the user enter a number and tell them if it's even or odd.

```python
while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("Enter an integer (or 'q' to quit): ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'q':
            break

        number = int(user_input)

        if number % 2 == 0:
            print(f"The number {number} is EVEN.")
        else:
            print(f"The number {number} is ODD.")

    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer or 'q'.")

print("Exiting program.")
```

Choose the example that best fits your specific need! The `number % 2 == 0` condition is the core logic you'll use in almost any scenario.

2025-11-30 21:37:36.112978 - RESPONSE: The most common way to find out if a number is even in programming is to use the **modulo operator (`%`)**.

An even number is an integer that is perfectly divisible by 2, meaning it leaves no remainder when divided by 2.

Here's how you can do it in several popular programming languages:

---

## Python

Python is often used for examples due to its readability.

### 1. Check if a single number is even

```python
def is_even(number):
  """
  Checks if a given number is even.
  An even number is perfectly divisible by 2, leaving no remainder.
  """
  return number % 2 == 0

# Test cases
print(f"Is 4 even? {is_even(4)}")      # Output: Is 4 even? True
print(f"Is 7 even? {is_even(7)}")      # Output: Is 7 even? False
print(f"Is 0 even? {is_even(0)}")      # Output: Is 0 even? True (0 is considered even)
print(f"Is -2 even? {is_even(-2)}")    # Output: Is -2 even? True
```

### 2. Find even numbers in a range

```python
def find_even_in_range(start, end):
  """
  Finds all even numbers within a specified range (inclusive).
  """
  even_numbers = []
  for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if num % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(num)
  return even_numbers

# Test
start_num = 1
end_num = 15
evens = find_even_in_range(start_num, end_num)
print(f"Even numbers between {start_num} and {end_num}: {evens}")
# Output: Even numbers between 1 and 15: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]

# Using a list comprehension (more Pythonic)
evens_comprehension = [num for num in range(start_num, end_num + 1) if num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers (comprehension): {evens_comprehension}")
```

### 3. Extract even numbers from a list

```python
def extract_even_from_list(numbers_list):
  """
  Extracts all even numbers from a given list of numbers.
  """
  even_numbers = []
  for num in numbers_list:
    if num % 2 == 0:
      even_numbers.append(num)
  return even_numbers

# Test
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -4, 0]
even_numbers_in_list = extract_even_from_list(my_list)
print(f"Even numbers in the list: {even_numbers_in_list}")
# Output: Even numbers in the list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, -4, 0]

# Using a list comprehension (more Pythonic)
even_numbers_comprehension = [num for num in my_list if num % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers (comprehension): {even_numbers_comprehension}")
```

---

## JavaScript

### 1. Check if a single number is even

```javascript
function isEven(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
}

console.log(`Is 4 even? ${isEven(4)}`);   // Output: Is 4 even? true
console.log(`Is 7 even? ${isEven(7)}`);   // Output: Is 7 even? false
console.log(`Is 0 even? ${isEven(0)}`);   // Output: Is 0 even? true
console.log(`Is -2 even? ${isEven(-2)}`); // Output: Is -2 even? true
```

### 2. Find even numbers in a range

```javascript
function findEvenInRange(start, end) {
  const evenNumbers = [];
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      evenNumbers.push(i);
    }
  }
  return evenNumbers;
}

const startNum = 1;
const endNum = 15;
const evens = findEvenInRange(startNum, endNum);
console.log(`Even numbers between ${startNum} and ${endNum}: ${evens}`);
// Output: Even numbers between 1 and 15: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14
```

### 3. Extract even numbers from a list (array)

```javascript
function extractEvenFromArray(numbersArray) {
  return numbersArray.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
}

const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -4, 0];
const evenNumbersInArray = extractEvenFromArray(myArray);
console.log(`Even numbers in the array: ${evenNumbersInArray}`);
// Output: Even numbers in the array: 2,4,6,8,10,-4,0
```

## C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // For std::iota if you wanted to fill a vector with a range

// 1. Check if a single number is even
bool isEven(int number) {
    return number % 2 == 0;
}

// 2. Find even numbers in a range
std::vector<int> findEvenInRange(int start, int end) {
    std::vector<int> evenNumbers;
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            evenNumbers.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return evenNumbers;
}

// 3. Extract even numbers from a vector (list)
std::vector<int> extractEvenFromVector(const std::vector<int>& numbersVector) {
    std::vector<int> evenNumbers;
    for (int number : numbersVector) { // Range-based for loop
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            evenNumbers.push_back(number);
        }
    }
    return evenNumbers;
}

int main() {
    // Test 1
    std::cout << "Is 4 even? " << (isEven(4) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is 7 even? " << (isEven(7) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is 0 even? " << (isEven(0) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is -2 even? " << (isEven(-2) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Test 2
    int startNum = 1;
    int endNum = 15;
    std::vector<int> evensInRange = findEvenInRange(startNum, endNum);
    std::cout << "Even numbers between " << startNum << " and " << endNum << ": ";
    for (int num : evensInRange) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl << std::endl;

    // Test 3
    std::vector<int> myVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -4, 0};
    std::vector<int> evenNumbersInVector = extractEvenFromVector(myVector);
    std::cout << "Even numbers in the vector: ";
    for (int num : evenNumbersInVector) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Key takeaway:** The fundamental operation across all these languages is `number % 2 == 0`. The rest is just about how you iterate through numbers or handle collections in that specific language.
